## Overview

**[HackNEO](http://hackNEO.org)** was a two-day regional event held at the [Summit Artspace](http://www.akronareaarts.org/summit-artspace/) in Downtown Akron on June 1st and 2nd. The hack-a-thon was Northeast Ohio’s iteration of the National Day of Civic Hacking, which included some 95 events and an estimated 10,000 participants. NDoCH events were sponsored by organizations ranging from the White House to NASA to Intel and IBM.

HackNEO was produced by [Code for Summit County](http://codeforsummitcounty.org), the new volunteer civic technology “Brigade” in Greater Akron. HackNEO was Code for Summit County’s first event, after being founded in March of 2013 by local software developer [Persa Zula](http://persazula.com). The event was sponsored by local businesses like [TinyCircuits](http://tiny-circuits.com/) and [Fathom](http://fathomdelivers.com), as well as non-profits like the [Knight Foundation](http://www.knightfoundation.org/communities/akron/) and [SYN/HAK](http://synhak.org).

Over the weekend, some 30 volunteers--which included software developers, designers, public officials, park staff, park volunteers, and regular citizens--built two prototype applications. Each application has been submitted to the White House and major sponsors for consideration of national recognition. Active development will continue through June 30th, when consideration closes. Development will continue after June 30th as well, in coordination with stakeholders. 

## Summit County Parks Mapping Application

### Background

With the help of Cleveland Metroparks staff Stephen Mather and Tom Kraft, HackNEO volunteers adapted a mature, responsive web application originally developed on behalf of Cleveland Metroparks. The application was forked, creating an independent application, using park and trail data from Metro Parks Serving Summit County and the Cuyahoga Valley National Park. 

This represents a fascinating innovation in the civic technology movement: web technology developed by one public agency deployed on behalf of other public agencies in the region, by citizen volunteers from the community.

### Functionality

The application prototype, which can be found at [trails.hackneo.org](http://trails.hackneo.org) allows users to find parks and trails based on a number of filters. Distance, feature, activity, featured routes and places--all are variables by which users can discover destinations. Once destinations are returned, park users can find directions by car, transit or walking. Users can then share the maps they generate with friends via email or social media.

### Future of the App

1. Standardize data across the participating parks and trail agencies of Summit County. Develop and publish the standard as a prerequisite for other implementations

2. Create a distinctive implementation for Summit County, including a visual identity and curated suite of functionality.

3. Over the coming months, analyze and document the application’s codebase to identify opportunities to refactor towards object-orientation and modularity. Refactor the application to be less resource-intensive.

4. Create best-in-class tools and protocols for collaboration to ensure sustainability. This includes excellent documentation, a healthy culture for bug tracking and issue discussion, clear goals and a common vocabulary.

##ParkScore: A Park Access Analysis Tool

### Background

ParkScore is a simple web app designed to help policy makers and park planners better understand how their parks, trails and green spaces serve the communities they call home. 

ParkScore is a response to the [U.S Census Bureau’s American Community Challenge](http://www.hackforchange.org/challenge/census-american-community-challenge).

### Functionality

ParkScore combines demographic and geographic data from the U.S. Census Bureau with spatial data from the National Park Service, Metro Parks Serving Summit County and Cleveland Metroparks.

ParkScore allows the user to see the total population, the demographic breakdown of that population, and top-level income statistics of the areas within walking distance (.5 miles) from all of the region’s parks, parks operated by a specific agency, or one or more individual parks.  We think ParkScore is a valuable tool for park planner and policy makers at multiple phases of the capital improvement process, whenever equity is a primary consideration.

### Future of the App

1. Document how to implement the app, contributions, etc.

2. Incorporate the ability to adjust the “buffer” to other relevant distances, and incorporate routing to generate those buffers that takes into consideration true access points and real street routes.

3. Create a unique visual identity and style guide

4. Incorporate bike route and transit data to show the full extent of park access without an automobile.

##Get Involved

Although HackNEO is over, we have a growing number of civic hackers involved with [Code for Summit County](http://codeforsummitcounty.org). We meet at least twice a month for hack nights to work on our projects, including these projects from the hackathon. As our member base grows, our projects diversify, and our ability to help advance the adoption of open, machine-readable data, also grows. Join us at one of our many [meetups](http://www.meetup.com/Code-for-Summit-County/) to lend a hand!
